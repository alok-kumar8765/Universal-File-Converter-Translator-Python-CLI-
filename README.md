	 we can handle file size upto 30 MB, and Page Count
	 upto 4000.
	 
	 This is just a beta/Prototype.
	 
	We Also Provide Laguage Translation.
		- you have to uploade your file, Select the language

		you will get the proper file in your desired language.
		
		- We Supported file size upto 40 MB.
		- Currently this translation feature worked when you are 
		connected to internet, but we also have offfline mode which 
		is little bulky size.

# ⚙️ Installation

	```bash

	# Clone repo
	git clone https://github.com/alok-kumar8765/Universal-File-Converter-Translator-Python-CLI-.git
	cd your-repo

	# Install dependencies
	pip install -r requirements.txt

	```
---

# Requirement 

| While installing the following requirements you might face some trouble, here is the solution
	
	 ```# Install required libraries (run in Colab / once in laptop)```
	 !pip install pypandoc pdfplumber python-docx pandas openpyxl pillow googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
	 !pip install deep-translator
	 !apt-get install pandoc
	 !pip install pypandoc
	 !pip install reportlab

---

# How to Use

- **Colab**

- Upload your files → Run cells → Call functions.
- Example:

	```
		pdf_to_text("input.pdf", "output.txt")
		translate_file("input.pdf", "translated.txt", src_lang="en", dest_lang="fr")
			
	```

- **Offline (Laptop)**

- Install dependencies:

	```
		pip install pypandoc pdfplumber python-docx pandas openpyxl pillow googletrans==4.0.0-rc1

	```

- Run the script with python file_toolkit.py

# 🚀 Usage (CLI Tool in Colab / Local)

<small>	This tool runs as a CLI menu.

When you run the program, you’ll see options to convert a TXT file into multiple formats.</small>

## 🔹 1. Source & Target Language Codes

	| You type language codes (ISO-639-1):
		| Language              | Code    |
		| --------------------- | ------- |
		| English               | `en`    |
		| Hindi                 | `hi`    |
		| French                | `fr`    |
		| German                | `de`    |
		| Greek                 | `el`    |
		| Chinese (Simplified)  | `zh-CN` |
		| Chinese (Traditional) | `zh-TW` |
		| Spanish               | `es`    |
		| Russian               | `ru`    |
		| Japanese              | `ja`    |
		| Korean                | `ko`    |
		| Arabic                | `ar`    |
		| Italian               | `it`    |
	
	👉 Example:
	
		> src_lang = en, dest_lang = hi → English ➝ Hindi
		
		> src_lang = auto, dest_lang = fr → Auto detect ➝ French

## 🔹 2. Where to See the Translated File in Colab

| After running, it saved your file as:

	``` file_name.txt ```
	
| 📍 Location: Colab working directory (/content/)

	| To check:

		``` !ls ```
	
	| To open & read inside Colab:

		 with open("B20442415 (5)_hi.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
			print(f.read()[:500])   # show first 500 chars
		
		
	| To download to your laptop:
	
		 from google.colab import files
			files.download("B20442415 (5)_hi.txt")
		
---

### Error while translation developer might face
	
> 🔹 Why It Didn’t Translate

- **1.** If the input text is too long, Google rejects it. 

- **2.** If you pass the entire PDF/doc content at once, it fails silently.

- **3.** Some versions of googletrans are broken in Colab. 
	
> 🔹 Solution: Split Text into Chunks


- We will split the text into smaller pieces, translate each, then join them.

		 from deep_translator import GoogleTranslator

			def translate_text(text, src_lang="auto", dest_lang="en"):
				translated_chunks = []
				# Split into ~4000 character chunks (Google safe limit)
				chunk_size = 4000
				for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size):
					chunk = text[i:i+chunk_size]
					translated = GoogleTranslator(source=src_lang, target=dest_lang).translate(chunk)
					translated_chunks.append(translated)
				return "\n".join(translated_chunks)
